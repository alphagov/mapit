# You can ignore all of the settings below this point in the file
# unless you want to use the scripts for setting up MapIt Global.

# The scripts for setting up global MapIt rely on a Overpass API
# server.  For bulk imports (e.g. setting up a instance of Global
# MapIt) you should set up your own Overpass server locally, but for
# generating a few KML files from OSM, it's easier to just use a
# remote server.
LOCAL_OVERPASS: False

# If you want to use a local overpass server (i.e. LOCAL_OVERPASS is
# True) then you should specify here the path to the database
# directory.
OVERPASS_DB_DIRECTORY: '/home/overpass/db/'

# If you're using a remote overpass server (i.e. LOCAL_OVERPASS is
# False) you should set its URL here. Please be aware that these
# scripts can put a lot of load on the remote server, so set up your
# own Overpass server for bulk imports.
